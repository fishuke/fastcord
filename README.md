# Fastcord
Faster Discord Desktop Client Made with Rust & React

## Motivation
Discord is cool but electron is not. 
Discord Desktop consumes too much memory, cpu and still not stable.
So we decided to remake discord desktop client with the power of tauri and rust.
This project is under development, hope discord likes the idea and consider rust.
